TODO: Write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).

NOTE: Another way to do this might be like a lambda in C#, so you could before an action on every row, that action being parse and add to a list somewhere else
NOTE: Also this entire problem is actually a pipe and filter
TODO: Get Input String from the file
TODO: Make It a testable wrapper

TODO: Convert Data into usable format
My mind thinks the tests are like this,
TODO: First DayId
TODO: Second DayId
TODO: Last DayID
TODO: First Day has MinTemperature
TODO: Second Day has MinTemperature
TODO: Last Day has MinTemperature

TODO: Output like this loop through and print Day Number: X | Min Temp: X


IMPROVEMENTS
Let someone else configure the column locations
Let someone else provide the header column names instead of column index
pipe and filter
pipe and filter threaded


Process a file
create dictionary using the headers as keys
read all rows that arent all white space and store values in dictionary of lists
architect the means to add observers that can perform actions such as print at read time

Tests should be simplified, 
keep read as an integration test
We should test 2 things, one is the resulting dictionary
the other should be output using the observers
the soccer one would obviously be the averaging
